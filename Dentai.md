# DentAI — Build Summary

A record of everything built so far: what exists, how it's organized, and what's still open. Written to be handed to anyone picking up the project — a teammate, a future session, or your backend engineer.

---

## 1. What DentAI is

A Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) frontend for dentists. It's frontend-only by design — no AI/ML logic lives here. It authenticates users, collects patient data and CBCT scans, and renders diagnosis/treatment results returned by an external FastAPI backend. Every screen is currently backed by a realistic mock layer so the app is fully clickable end-to-end before that backend exists.

**Stack:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS v4, React Router, Framer Motion, React Hook Form + Zod, Axios, Lucide React, Context API.

**Design:** dark clinical theme — background `#111827`, surface `#1F2937`, teal accent `#14B8A6`, Poppins for headings / Inter for body — matching the original brief exactly, wired as Tailwind v4 `@theme` tokens.

## 2. Build order (what happened, in sequence)

### Phase 0 — Architecture plan
Folder structure, data-flow rules (Component → hook → Service → api/ → apiClient → backend), auth flow, routing map, and a mock-data strategy (`VITE_USE_MOCKS` env flag) agreed before any code was written.

### Phase 1 — Foundation
Vite + Tailwind v4 scaffold, design tokens, the full folder structure, and every reusable UI primitive: `Button`, `Input`, `Textarea`, `Select`, `Card`, `Badge`, `ProgressBar`, `Modal`, `ConfirmationDialog`, `Toast`, `Avatar`, `Dropdown`, `SearchInput`, `Skeleton`, `LoadingOverlay`, `Pagination`, `Table`, and later `Switch`. Shared shell: `Sidebar` (collapsible + mobile drawer), `Breadcrumb`, `Navbar`. `AuthLayout` / `DashboardLayout`. `AuthContext`, `ThemeContext`, `NotificationContext` and their hooks. `apiClient` with JWT injection and 401 handling. Full route tree with `ProtectedRoute`, lazy-loaded pages. Login/Register/Forgot Password working end-to-end against mocks.

### Phase 2 — Core diagnosis loop
The app's central workflow, built vertically end-to-end:
- **New Diagnosis**: one `react-hook-form` instance across three sections (Patient Info / Clinical Notes / CBCT Upload), Zod-validated, drag-and-drop `FileUploader` restricted to `.dcm` / `.nii.gz`.
- **Processing**: a `usePolling` hook watches a mock session progress through five stages (Uploading → Preparing → Processing → Generating → Finalizing) with an animated `ProcessingStages` component, then auto-redirects.
- **Diagnosis Result**: patient summary, input summary, `CBCTPreviewPanel` (placeholder, shaped for a real viewer), a `ResultsTable` with `ConfidenceBadge`/`ConfidenceBar` (both driven by one threshold config), clinical notes summary.
- **Treatment Plan**: vertical `Timeline` of expandable `TreatmentPhaseCard`s (objectives, description, recommendations, expected outcomes), clinician notes, save/print/report actions.

### Phase 3 — Patients & Reports
- **Patients**: searchable/sortable/paginated table (mock dataset of 8), create/edit modal (`PatientForm`, Zod-validated), delete with `ConfirmationDialog`, click-through to profile.
- **Patient Profile**: info card, visit timeline (reusing the Phase 2 `Timeline`), placeholder sections for notes/reports.
- **Reports**: searchable/paginated table with status badges, `ReportPreviewModal`, download action.

### Phase 4 — Dashboard
Real content wired from the services built in Phases 2–3: four stat cards (Total Patients, Diagnoses Completed, Reports Generated, System Status), a paginated recent-diagnoses table (View jumps straight to that patient's profile), `QuickActions` shortcuts, a live `RecentReports` list pulled from `ReportService`, and a `SystemStatus` indicator.

### Phase 5 — Settings
Every section from the brief: Profile (name/email/clinic, Zod-validated), Password (current/new/confirm with match validation), Notifications (three toggle switches via the new `Switch` primitive), Theme (status display — dark-only for v1, wired through `ThemeContext` so a real switcher slots in later), System Information (read-only version/environment/last-updated).

### Phase 6 — Accessibility & responsive polish
Keyboard support for clickable table rows (Tab + Enter/Space with visible focus), `Dropdown` closes on Escape, `Modal` traps Tab and restores focus to its trigger on close, a "Skip to main content" link, `aria-label`s on icon-only controls, and the Navbar's global **Search** field (from the original spec) added — it deep-links into Patients via `?q=`, and `PatientsList` reads that query on load.

### Phase 7 — Error handling
Reusable `ErrorState` (title, message, retry button) and a top-level `ErrorBoundary` catching render crashes app-wide. Wired into `DiagnosisResult`, `TreatmentPlan`, and `PatientProfile`. Extended to the list-style pages — `PatientsList`, `Reports`, `Dashboard` — which previously swallowed fetch failures into a misleading "no results" empty state; they now show a real error message with retry.

Every file above exists and the project builds clean (`npm run build`) as of this summary.

## 4. How the mock layer works

Every `api/*.js` file exports functions with the **real intended signature**. Internally, each checks `VITE_USE_MOCKS` (from `.env`) and either:
- returns realistic mock data (with artificial latency via `mockDelay`, so loading states are actually exercised), or
- makes the real `apiClient` call.

This means `services/` and everything above them (hooks, components, pages) were written once, against the final contract. **Flipping `VITE_USE_MOCKS=false` and pointing `VITE_API_BASE_URL` at the real FastAPI backend requires zero component changes** — only the `api/*.js` files' real-call branches need to match the actual backend response shapes.

The diagnosis flow's mock is stateful: submitting a New Diagnosis form creates an in-memory session that progresses through processing stages based on elapsed time, so Processing's polling behavior is genuinely exercised rather than faked with a timeout.

---

## 5. Known gaps / deliberately deferred

- **Real backend connection** — needs your FastAPI service to exist; the seam is ready (see §4).
- **CBCT viewer** — `CBCTPreviewPanel` is a placeholder shaped for a real DICOM/NIfTI viewer library; not integrated yet, since that's a meaningful dependency choice best made once real scan data is available.
- **`src/types/`** — the architecture plan called for JSDoc typedefs documenting each API contract (patient, diagnosis, treatment, report, user); not yet created.
- **Automated tests** — no test suite yet (Vitest would be the natural fit given the Vite setup).
- **README / deployment docs** — not yet written.
- **Patient visit history, clinical notes, and reports-per-patient** on the Patient Profile page are still placeholder sections — they'll come alive once linked to real diagnosis/report data per patient.

## 6. Running it

```
cd dentai
npm install
npm run dev
```

Log in with any non-empty email/password (mocks accept anything). `.env` controls mock mode:
```
VITE_USE_MOCKS=true
VITE_API_BASE_URL=/api
```
